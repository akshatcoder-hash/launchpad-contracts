# Taopad Launchpad Protocol

The Taopad Launchpad Protocol is a decentralized platform for launching token sales. It allows projects to raise funds by selling tokens to the public in a fair and transparent manner. The protocol includes features such as setting the price of tokens in ETH, defining minimum and maximum token purchase limits, specifying start and end dates for the token sale, and implementing a vesting schedule for token release.

The protocol also supports the creation of multiple launchpads, each with its own set of parameters, and provides functionality for managing the whitelist, updating the protocol fee, and transferring ownership of purchased tokens.

The LaunchpadFactory contract address on buildbear testnet is: `0x9fe193f45bE5532E6E5E15591C297eaFfF436F3b`.

The LaunchpadFactory contract manages the creation and management of individual launchpads, while the Launchpad contract handles the token sale process, including purchasing tokens, claiming tokens, and managing the vesting schedule.

Overall, the Taopad Launchpad Protocol provides a robust and flexible framework for conducting token sales in a secure and efficient manner.
